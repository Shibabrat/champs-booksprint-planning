    "One of the biggest challenges of Dynamical Systems Theory or Nonlinear Dynamics is the development of mathematical techniques that provide us with the capability of exploring the geometrical template of structures that governs transport in phase space. Since the early 1900, the idea of pursuing a qualitative description of the solutions of differential equations, which emerged from the pioneering work carried out by Henri Poincaré on the three body problem of Celestial Mechanics \\cite{hp1890}, has had a profound impact on our understanding of the nonlinear character of natural phenomena. Indeed, this powerful approach has now been widely embraced by the scientific community and its essence was nicely captured by Vladimir Arnold's statement that a complete description of Classical Mechanics boils down to the geometrical analysis of phase space. \n",

    "In this chapter we present the details of a mathematical tool whose potential brings us  one step closer to fulfilling the long-soght dream envisioned by Poincaré. The method is known in the literature as Lagrangian descriptors (LDs) and has the capability of revealing the geometrical template of phase space structures that characterizes trajectories with qualitatively distinct dynamical behavior. As we will see, this method provides us with a systematic way of exploring phase space by means of looking at its dynamical skeleton using low-dimensional slices. This procedure allows for a complete reconstruction, i.e. a *phase space tomography* of the intricate geometry of underlying invariant manifolds that characterize transport mechanisms."

    "aaddddddddddddddddducture. The method nicely captures this distinct dynamical behavior allowing to recover the geometrical template of invariant manifolds that characterizes phase space transport. This detection of invariant manifolds by means of sharp changes in the scalar field values of LDs has been mathematically quantified in terms of the notion of ''singular structures'' in the LDs plots, which are easy to recognize visually \\cite{mancho2013lagrangian,lopesino2017}."
