   Journal = {Commun. Nonlinear. Sci. Numer. Simulat.},
   Volume = {18},
   Number = {12},
   Pages = {3530-3557},
   Abstract = {In this paper we develop new techniques for revealing geometrical structures in phase space that are valid for aperiodically time dependent dynamical systems, which we refer to as Lagrangian descriptors. These quantities are based on the integration, for a finite time, along trajectories of an intrinsic bounded, positive geometrical and/or physical property of the trajectory itself. We discuss a general methodology for constructing Lagrangian descriptors, and we discuss a “heuristic argument” that explains why this method is successful for revealing geometrical structures in the phase space of a dynamical system. We support this argument by explicit calculations on a benchmark problem having a hyperbolic fixed point with stable and unstable manifolds that are known analytically. Several other benchmark examples are considered that allow us the assess the performance of Lagrangian descriptors in revealing invariant tori and regions of shear. Throughout the paper “side-by-side” comparisons of the performance of Lagrangian descriptors with both finite time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs) and finite time averages of certain components of the vector field (“time averages”) are carried out and discussed. In all cases Lagrangian descriptors are shown to be both more accurate and computationally efficient than these methods. We also perform computations for an explicitly three dimensional, aperiodically time-dependent vector field and an aperiodically time dependent vector field defined as a data set. Comparisons with FTLEs and time averages for these examples are also carried out, with similar conclusions as for the benchmark examples.},

We also provide some perspectives regarding the general applicability of VTST.},

   Abstract = {The Transition State dividing surface is a key concept, not only for the precise calculation of the rate constant of a reaction, but also for the proper prediction of product ratios. The correct location of this surface is defined by the requirement that reactive trajectories do not recross it. In the case of reactions in solution the solvent plays an important role in the location of the dividing surface. In this paper we show with the aid of a model Hamiltonian that the effective mass of the solvent can dramatically change the location of the dividing surface.},
