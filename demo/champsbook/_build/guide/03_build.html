<h1 id="Building-and-publishing-your-book">Building and publishing your book<a class="anchor-link" href="#Building-and-publishing-your-book"> </a></h1><p>Once you've added content and configured your book, it's time to
build the HTML for each <strong>page</strong> of your book. We'll use the
<code>jupyter-book build</code> command-line tool for this. In the <em>next step</em>,
we'll stitch these HTML pages into a book.</p>
<h2 id="Prerequisites">Prerequisites<a class="anchor-link" href="#Prerequisites"> </a></h2><p>In order to build the HTML for each page, you should have followed the steps
in <a href="02_create.html">creating your Jupyter Book structure</a>. You should have
a Jupyter Book structure in a local folder on your computer, a collection
of notebook/markdown files in your <code>content/</code> folder, a <code>_data/toc.yml</code> file
that defines the structure of your book, and any configuration you'd like
in the <code>config.yml</code> file.</p>
<h2 id="Build-each-page's-HTML">Build each page's HTML<a class="anchor-link" href="#Build-each-page's-HTML"> </a></h2><p>Now that your book's content is in the <code>content/</code> folder and you've
defined your book's structure in <code>_data/toc.yml</code>, you can build
the HTML for each page of your book.</p>
<p>Do so by running the following command:</p>

<pre><code>jupyter-book build mybookname/</code></pre>
<p>This will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the links specified in the <code>_data/toc.yml</code> file (pointing to files in <code>/content/</code>) and
do the following:<ul>
<li>Run <code>nbconvert</code> to turn the content files (e.g., <code>.ipynb</code>, <code>.md</code>, etc) files into HTML</li>
<li>Replace relative image file paths so that they work on your new built book</li>
<li>Place all these generated files in the <code>mybookname/_build/</code> directory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After this step is finished, you should have a collection of HTML files in your
<code>_build/</code> folder.</p>
<h3 id="Page-HTML-caching">Page HTML caching<a class="anchor-link" href="#Page-HTML-caching"> </a></h3><p>By default, Jupyter Book will only build the HTML for pages that have
been updated since the last time you built the book. This helps reduce the
amount of unnecessary time needed to build your book. If you'd like to
force Jupyter Book to re-build a particular page, you can either edit the
corresponding file in the <code>content/</code> folder, or delete that page's HTML
in the <code>_build/</code> folder.</p>
<h2 id="Create-an-online-repository-for-your-book">Create an <em>online</em> repository for your book<a class="anchor-link" href="#Create-an-online-repository-for-your-book"> </a></h2><p>You've created your book on your own computer, but you haven't yet added it
online. This section covers the steps to create your own GitHub repository,
and to add your book's content to it. In this case, we'll use GitHub-Pages
to build the HTML for your book. However, you can also build the book's HTML
manually. Both will be covered in <a href="04_publish.html">building and publishing your book</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>First, log-in to GitHub, then go to the "create a new repository" page:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/new">https://github.com/new</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Next, add a name and description for your book. You can choose whatever
initialization you'd like.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now, clone the empty repository to your computer:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git clone https://github.com/&lt;my-org&gt;/&lt;my-book-name&gt;
</pre></div>
</li>
<li><p>Copy all of your book files and folders (what was created when you ran <code>jupyter-book create mybook</code>)
into the new repository. For example, if you created your book locally with <code>jupyter-book create mylocalbook</code>
and your online repository is called <code>myonlinebook</code>, the command would be:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>cp -r mylocalbook/* myonlinebook/
</pre></div>
<p>This will copy over the local book files into the online book folder.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Commit the new files to the repository in <code>myonlinebook/</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">cd</span> myonlinebook
git add ./*
git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;adding my first book!&quot;</span>
git push
</pre></div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it!</p>
<h2 id="Next-step:-build-your-book">Next step: build your book<a class="anchor-link" href="#Next-step:-build-your-book"> </a></h2><p>Now that you've created the HTML for each page of your book, it's time
to stitch them together into a book. That's covered in the next section.</p>
